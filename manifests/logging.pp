# == Class: base_firewall::logging
#
# Configures rsyslog and logrotate for iptables. Rsyslog is configured
# to write iptables messages to their own file. Logrotate is configured
# to manage this iptables log file.
#
# This class only supports RedHat/Centos because it makes assumptions on
# service names and configuration directory locations. It may work on
# other operating systems but has not been tested.
